Excited to share that I’ve developed a fully responsive Gym Web App using React, Material-UI, and API integration! 💪
Key Features:
Responsive Design: Ensuring seamless experience across all devices 📱💻
Exercise Details: Click on any exercise to see a detailed description, YouTube videos, similar exercises by equipment, and target muscle groups 🎯💪
React-Based: Dynamic and efficient user interface ⚛️
API Integration: Real-time data handling 🛠️
Material-UI: Clean and modern UI components 🎨
This project allowed me to dive deeper into building rich, interactive user experiences. I’m looking forward to leveraging these skills in future projects!
Check it out and let me know what you think! 🙌
